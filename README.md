# Task Make

You will analyze data from a list of space missions. Each mission has information about its name, year, and success status. You will use a for loop to process this data and extract useful information.

Write a Python program that:

    1. Counts the total number of space missions.
    2. Counts the number of successful missions.
    3. Calculates the success rate of the missions.
    4. Lists all the missions that were launched before the year 2000.

Data Sample (this is in your main file) to use:
        mission_names = ['Apollo 11', 'Challenger', 'Curiosity Rover', 'Viking 1', 'Mars Pathfinder', 'Hubble Telescope', 'Apollo 13']
        mission_years = [1969, 1986, 2012, 1975, 1996, 1990, 1970]
        mission_success = [True, False, True, True, True, True, False]

Steps:

    1. Implement the Analysis:
            Use a for loop to iterate through the list of missions.
            Count the total number of missions.
            Count the number of successful missions.
            Identify and list all missions launched before the year 2000.

    2. Output the Results:
            Print the total number of missions.
            Print the number of successful missions.
            Print the success rate as a percentage.
            Print the names of the missions launched before the year 2000.

Your output should be formatted in the following way to the terminal:
Total number of missions: 7
Number of successful missions: 5
Success rate: 71.43%
Missions launched before the year 2000:
- Apollo 11
- Challenger
- Viking 1
- Mars Pathfinder
- Hubble Telescope
- Apollo 13
